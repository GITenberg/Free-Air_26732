description: "Free-to-air (FTA) are television (TV) and radio services broadcast in\
  \ clear (unencrypted) form, allowing any person with the appropriate receiving equipment\
  \ to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a subscription,\
  \ other ongoing cost or one-off fee (e.g. Pay-per-view). In the traditional sense,\
  \ this is carried on terrestrial radio signals and received with an antenna.\nFTA\
  \ also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription\
  \ is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another\
  \ carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g. cable, satellite or the Internet.\
  \ These carriers may be mandated (or opt) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels\
  \ even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment\
  \ is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for\
  \ emergency broadcasts, similar to the 112 emergency service provided by mobile\
  \ phone operators and manufacturers.\nFree-to-view (FTV) is, generally, available\
  \ without subscription but is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.\n\
  Free-to-air is often used for international broadcasting, making it something of\
  \ a video equivalent to shortwave radio.\nMost FTA retailers list free to air channel\
  \ guides and content available in North America for free to air use.\n From Wikipedia\
